 * happens at build or revalidation time from a short-lived serverless
 * invocation, which is exactly the shape HTTP suits — a connection pool would
 * spend its life being opened and thrown away.
 *
 * Built per call rather than held in a module constant so that a missing
 * DATABASE_URL fails at the point of use with a message naming the fix, rather
 * than throwing during module evaluation somewhere with no useful stack.
